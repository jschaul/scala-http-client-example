# scala-http-example

A sample repo to show people new to Scala, play-json and ScalaWS client how to make use of these. 

Meant to be used as basis for individual tutoring/pair programming, this is not a stand-alone resource nor a full tutorial (yet?)

Code is intentionally not fully refactored by just featuring one "main" method. (Can be done by the person learning)

## setup

Either type `sbt` if you have it already, or execute `./activator` to get an sbt shell.

Once in the sbt shell, you can execute

* `compile`
* `test`
* `run`

(or type `tasks` to see more possibilities)
